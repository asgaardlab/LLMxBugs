Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game tester. In Fallout 4, the conversation sequence starts when the player approaches the woman who has a cat standing on her shoulder. However, if the player moves away from the woman before the conversation starts, the conversation won't start. This bug is caused by a bug in the game's AI.

(a) A person is parachuting in the air
(b) A plane approaches the parachuter
(c) The plane hits the cord and lost its right wing
(d) The plane fell from the sky and explodes

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game tester. In this sequence, the bug is the plane losing its right wing. If the wing was attached to the plane's right side, it would have been in the air and the parachuter would have been able to land safely. However, because the wing was detached, the parachuter was unable to land and was killed.
