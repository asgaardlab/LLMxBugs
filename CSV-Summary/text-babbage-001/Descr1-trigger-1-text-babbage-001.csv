(c) Multiple signs spawns on the roof of the van
(d) The van exits the building on the other end leaving tons of taco signs inside the building

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's reason the events according to the reference game:

(a) The taco van drives towards the entrance of the parkade. The sign on the roof of the van hits the ceiling of the building and falls off. This causes the van to exit the building on the other end leaving tons of taco signs inside the building.

(b) Multiple signs spawns on the roof of the van. This causes the van to enter and exit the building multiple times, leaving tons of taco signs inside the building.
