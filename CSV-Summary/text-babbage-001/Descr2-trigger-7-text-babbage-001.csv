Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game designer. In this sequence, the player is crouching and then sliding down a hill. If the player were to stand up and fly directly up into the sky, they would not be able to do so again until they resumed crouching. This bug is caused by the player's animation being too fast.

(a) Two deer carcasses are floating in the air
(b) The player walks beside the carcasses
(c) The player walks through one of the carcasses
(d) The player collides with the other carcass

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game designer. If the player walks by one of the carcasses, it's probably because they're trying to avoid a trap. If the player collides with the other carcass, it's probably because they're trying to get to the other carcass.

}","Q: In the The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt video game, the following sequence of events happened:

(a) The player is floating above the ground with compressed legs
(b) The player walks in the air above the ground
(c) The player walks in the air over a dog that is on the ground
(d) The player stands still hovering above the ground

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game designer. If you want to make a bug in your game, you would create a situation where the player could potentially exploit the bug. For example, if you want to make the player walk in the air over a dog on the ground, you could make the dog move, or make the player walk over it instead of just standing still.
