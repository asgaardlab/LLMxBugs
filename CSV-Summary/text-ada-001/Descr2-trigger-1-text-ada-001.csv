(a) The player rides a horse up next to a small tree
(b) The player dismounts the horse next to the small tree
(c) The player collides with the small tree
(d) The player dies

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's reason the events according to the reference game. If the player only dismounts at the small tree, then the game would say the player collides with the small tree. However, the game actually says the player dies.
