A:Let's think like a game designer. What would you like to see in a game that is both interesting and reality-based? There are many possibilities, but one of the most interesting might be an experience where players journey through a real-world location,livious to the consequences. In that case, it might be helpful to think of a game event that allows this type of control over experience.
