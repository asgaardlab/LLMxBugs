(a) A person rides a horse on a muddy road
(b) The person approaches a stagecoach
(c) The stagecoach jumps from the ground and remains in the air briefly
(d) The stagecoach falls back to the ground

Which event is a bug?

A:Let’s think step by step. The person approaches the stagecoach, which means the game is going to be a fight for survival. You can see the stagecoach jump from the ground and remain in the air for a moment, which means it was a bug. The stagecoach falls back to the ground, which is what the player would expect.
