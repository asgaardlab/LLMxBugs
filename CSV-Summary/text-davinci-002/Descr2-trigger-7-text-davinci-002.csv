(d) The man runs away from the player

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game designer. What's the most logical sequence of events? A player punches someone in a wheelchair, and the person in the wheelchair falls over. That's event (a). Then, the person in the wheelchair stands up, which is event (b). After that, the person in the wheelchair covers his face with his arms while squatting, which is event (c). Finally, the person in the wheelchair runs away from the player, which is event (d).

So, event (c) is the bug.

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game designer. If we were designing this game, we would want the player to be able to meditate anywhere, including outside of shops. We would also want the shop keeper to appear in his shop when the player finishes meditating. However, we would not want the shop keeper to be standing in a T-pose. Therefore, event (d) is a bug.
