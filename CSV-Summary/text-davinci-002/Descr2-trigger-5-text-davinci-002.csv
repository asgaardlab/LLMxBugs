(b) The enemy slides backwards while standing upright

(d) The raider lands on the ground beside the building

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game tester for a moment. If we were testing this game, we would want to know if the raider falling through the wall was intended behavior or not. To do that, we would need to know what the developers intended for the raider to do.

In this case, it's pretty clear that the developers did not intend for the raider to fall through the wall. Therefore, event (c) is a bug.

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game tester for a second. If we were testing this game, and we saw a man running on a highway filled with cars, we would expect him to be able to climb onto a trailer that is attached to a truck. However, if a game alert pops up and covers the screen, the truck and trailer disappear, and the man floats in the air, that would be a bug.

(a) A man walks up to a destroyed helicopter that is missing rotor blades
(b) The man enters the destroyed helicopter

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game tester for a moment. If we were testing this game, and we saw that a man could walk up to a destroyed helicopter, enter it, and take off without any rotor blades, we would definitely consider that a bug.

(a) The player mounts a horse standing in a lake
(b) The horse begins running forwards
(c) The player stays floating in place
(d) The horse drags the player through the air

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game tester for a second. If you were testing this game and came across this sequence of events, what would you think?

At first, you might think that event (c) is a bug. After all, the player shouldn't be able to float in place like that! But then you remember that this is a video game, and anything is possible in a video game.

So then you might think that event (d) is a bug. After all, the horse shouldn't be able to drag the player through the air like that! But then you remember that this is a video game, and anything is possible in a video game.

So then you might think that the whole sequence of events is a bug. After all, none of this should be possible in a video game! But then you remember that this is a video game, and anything is possible in a video game.

In conclusion, there is no event in this sequence that can definitively be called a bug.

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game tester for a moment. If you were testing this game, and you saw the player walk up to a closed door, step through it, and then attack an enemy, you would probably think that something was wrong. After all, doors are supposed to block players, not let them walk right through them! So event (b) is probably a bug.

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game tester for a moment. The first thing they would do is check if (a) the player throws a devil's puffball at a howler, (b) the devil's puffball releases poison gas beside the howler, and (c) the howler slides across the floor while twitching. If those three events happen as intended, then (d) the howler rotating by sliding on the floor is probably a bug.
