(a) A person attaches another person to a moving car via a grappling hook
(b) The person is pulled to the car
(c) The person starts circling the car while it is moving
(d) The person circling the car is killed

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game designer. If you were designing this game, which event would you want to happen? Would you want the person to be able to attach another person to a moving car and then be pulled to the car? Or would you want the person to be able to circle the car while it is moving?

It's most likely that the person being able to attach another person to a moving car and then be pulled to the car is a bug.

(d) The car hits another car yet both the deer and the person remains standing on top of the vehicle

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game designer. If we were designing this game, we would want the deer to be running on the hood of the vehicle, and we would want the person to be standing on the roof. However, we would not want the deer to lay its head down momentarily, because that would look strange. Therefore, event (c) is a bug.
