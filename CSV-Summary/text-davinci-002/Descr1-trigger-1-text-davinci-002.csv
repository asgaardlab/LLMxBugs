Which event is a bug?

A:Let's reason the events according to the reference game's mechanics. 

(a) A person enters a car and drives it away - this is a normal event and it doesn't seem to be a bug.
(b) The car is launched into the sky and appears to be severely damaged - this event is a bug because it's not supposed to happen according to the game's mechanics.
(c) The car hits the side of a building - this is a normal event and it doesn't seem to be a bug.
(d) The car hits and bounces off from a ceiling and falls to the ground - this event is a bug because it's not supposed to happen according to the game's mechanics.
Among (a) through (d), the answer is","{

This is a normal event. The person is able to enter the helicopter and take it off without any problems.

(b) The helicopter pulls a motorcycle via a rope and swings it around in the air

This is a normal event. The helicopter is able to pull the motorcycle and swing it around in the air without any problems.

(c) The motorcycle hits the helicopter and explodes

This is a normal event. The motorcycle hits the helicopter and explodes as intended.

(d) The helicopter is pushed downward rapidly while rotating and explodes

This is a bug. The helicopter is pushed downward rapidly and explodes, but it should not be able to rotate while doing so.
