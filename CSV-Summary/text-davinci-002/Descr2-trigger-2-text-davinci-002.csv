(a) The player initiates a shooting attack on a raider
(b) The bullet shot by the player collides with the raider
(c) The raider is sent flying upwards into the air
(d) The raider falls onto the ground

Which event is a bug?

A:Let’s think step by step. (a) is the player’s action, so that can’t be a bug. (b) is the result of the player’s action, so that can’t be a bug either. (c) is the result of the raider being hit by the bullet, so that’s not a bug. (d) is the result of the raider falling back to the ground, so that’s not a bug either.

Therefore, there are no bugs in this sequence of events.

(b) The row-boat capsizes deep into the lake
(c) The row-boat floats upright onto the surface of the lake
(d) The player is standing on the row-boat

Which event is a bug?

A:Let’s think step by step. 

The player climbs into a row-boat filled with people. This seems fine.

The row-boat capsizes deep into the lake. This could be a bug, depending on how the row-boat is supposed to behave. If the row-boat is supposed to stay afloat, then capsizing would be a bug.

The row-boat floats upright onto the surface of the lake. This could also be a bug, depending on how the row-boat is supposed to behave. If the row-boat is supposed to sink, then floating back to the surface would be a bug.

The player is standing on the row-boat. This could be a bug if the row-boat is supposed to be submerged. If the row-boat is supposed to be submerged, then the player should not be able to stand on it.

(a) A man is walking in front of the player
(b) The man stops walking
(c) The man falls down into the ground
(d) The man has disappeared

Which event is a bug?

A:Let’s think step by step. (a) is fine. (b) is also probably fine—the man might have just stopped to take a look around. But then in (c) the man falls down into the ground, which is definitely a bug. And finally in (d) the man has disappeared, which is also a bug. So the answer is that events (c) and (d) are both bugs.
