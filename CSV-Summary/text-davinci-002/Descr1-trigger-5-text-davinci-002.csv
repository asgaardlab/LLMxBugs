Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game tester for a moment. If we were testing this game, we would want to know if the door exploding is supposed to happen or not. We would also want to know if the game is supposed to freeze at that point. Based on that, we would say that event C is a bug.

(a) The person shoots and kills an NPC
(b) The person drops down a floor and aims at another person in slow motion
(c) The person shoots the other person and the latter is launched into the air
(d) The person falls back to the ground

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game tester for a moment. If we were testing this game, we would want to know if (a) the person shooting and killing an NPC is a bug. To test this, we would try to shoot and kill an NPC ourselves. If we were able to do so, then we would know that (a) is not a bug. However, if we were not able to shoot and kill an NPC, then we would know that (a) is a bug.

In the same way, we would test (b) by trying to drop down a floor and aim at another person in slow motion. If we were able to do so, then we would know that (b) is not a bug. However, if we were not able to drop down a floor and aim at another person in slow motion, then we would know that (b) is a bug.

(c) is a bit more tricky to test. To test this, we would need to find someone to shoot in slow motion. We would then need to see if the person is launched into the air. If the person is launched into the air, then we would know that (c) is not a bug. However, if the person is not launched into the air, then we

(a) A person aims a gun at another person standing on a staircase
(b) The person shoots the other person
(c) The other person is launched into the air 
(d) The other person falls on top of a radio tower and then falls back to the ground

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game tester for a moment. If we were testing this game, and we saw that when you shot someone they were launched into the air and then fell on top of a radio tower, we would definitely think that was a bug. So event (d) is a bug.

A:Let's think like a game tester. If we were testing this game, we would want to know if the person is able to jump over the fence, aim the bow, and walk through the fences without any issues. If the person is launched into the air, that would be considered a bug.

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game tester for a second. If we were testing this game, we would want to know if the player is able to complete the objective of planting a bomb on the antenna. If the player is able to do this, then the event is not a bug. However, if the player is not able to plant a bomb on the antenna, then the event is a bug.

(d) The person clips through the deer

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game tester for a moment. If you were testing this game, and you saw a person standing in a butcher house, with two deers that have been skinned floating in the air, what would you do?

The first thing you would do is try to walk toward the deers to see if you can clip through them. If you can, then that's a bug.

(b) The person clips through the pole of a shack
(c) The person clips through the ceiling of the shack
(d) The person freezes in mid-air

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game tester. 

The first event, jumping onto the railing, is not a bug. This is something that the player is intended to be able to do.

The second event, clipping through the pole of the shack, is a bug. This is not something that the player is intended to be able to do.

The third event, clipping through the ceiling of the shack, is a bug. This is not something that the player is intended to be able to do.

The fourth event, freezing in mid-air, is a bug. This is not something that the player is intended to be able to do.

}","Q: In the The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt video game, the following sequence of events happened:

(a) A person approaches the corner of a shack
(b) There is a pit at the corner of the shack
(c) The person drops into the pit
(d) The person appears to be falling yet his position does not actually move

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game tester for a moment. If you were testing this game, and you saw that a person could approach the corner of a shack, and then suddenly drop into a pit, you would probably think that something was wrong. After all, it doesn't make sense for a person to just suddenly fall into a pit. So event (d) is probably a bug.
Among (a) through (d), the answer is","{
