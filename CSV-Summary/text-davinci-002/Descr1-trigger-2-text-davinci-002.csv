The SUV then slides on the road while upside down. This could be a bug, or it could just be part of the game physics. It’s hard to say for sure.

A:Let’s think step by step. 

The first event, a person standing at the entrance of a railway tunnel, is not a bug. 

The second event, a fighter jet rotating and clipping through the ground, is a bug. 

The third event, the person using a grappling hook to hook onto the fighter jet, is not a bug. 

The fourth event, the person being struck by the rotating fighter jet and falling to the ground, is a bug.

A:Let’s think step by step. (a) A person picks up a dead body next to a dead horse. This could be the result of a fight, or simply someone picking up a dead body. There’s nothing particularly suspicious about this. (b) A stagecoach rider witnesses the crime. This is the first suspicious event. It’s possible that the stagecoach rider saw the person picking up the dead body and assumed that they were the one who killed the horse. (c) Weapon reel is displayed and the stagecoach is launched into the sky with the rider on it. This is definitely a bug. There’s no reason why the weapon reel should be displayed, and the stagecoach should not be launched into the sky. (d) The stagecoach falls from the sky which killed the rider and the horses. This is also a bug. The stagecoach should not be falling from the sky, and the rider and horses should not be killed as a result.
