(b) The person hovers backwards in the air
(c) The person's limbs and torso rotate in different directions
(d) The person rotates about a vertical axis

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's reason the events according to the reference game's canon:

(a) The person is floating because they were shot in the head and their body is still moving due to the shock.
(b) The person hovers backwards because they are still alive and their body is trying to keep them afloat.
(c) The person's limbs and torso rotate in different directions because they were shot in different parts of their body and the force of the gunshot is causing the body to rotate.
(d) The person rotates about a vertical axis because their body is still rotating about the vertical axis due to the force of the gunshot.

(d) The poor townsman walks in a circle with compressed legs

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's reason the events according to the reference game's logic.

(a) The player walks up to a poor townsman.

This is an event. The poor townsman is not a character in the game, but an in-game object. As such, the game treats this event as if the player had spoken to the poor townsman.

(b) The poor townsman is squatting on the floor with compressed legs.

This is an event. The poor townsman is not a character in the game, but an in-game object. As such, the game treats this event as if the player had interacted with the poor townsman.

(c) The poor townsman begins to walk with compressed legs.

This is an event. The poor townsman is not a character in the game, but an in-game object. As such, the game treats this event as if the player had interacted with the poor townsman.

(d) The poor townsman walks in a circle with compressed legs.

This is an event. The poor townsman is not a character in the game, but an in-game object. As such, the game treats this event as if the player had interacted with the poor townsman.
