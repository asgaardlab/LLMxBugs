(a) The raider teleports from the building to the ground
(b) A person approaches a raider with a gun
(c) The raider shoots the person using a gun
(d) The person attacks the raider and kills him

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game designer.

(a) The raider teleports from the building to the ground is a bug because it breaks the game's intended flow.

(b) A person approaches a raider with a gun is a bug because it introduces an unpredictable element into the game.

(c) The raider shoots the person using a gun is a bug because it causes the player to feel like they are powerless to stop the violence.

(d) The person attacks the raider and kills him is a bug because it makes the player feel like they are the killer instead of the victim.
