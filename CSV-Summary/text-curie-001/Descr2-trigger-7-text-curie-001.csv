(a) Two deer carcasses are floating in the air
(b) The player walks beside the carcasses
(c) The player walks through one of the carcasses
(d) The player collides with the other carcass

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game designer.

In order for the player to walk through a carcass, they would have to be close enough to it. If the player were to walk past it, they would have to collide with it in order for it to trigger the cutscene. This bug occurs when the player is too far away from the carcasses.
