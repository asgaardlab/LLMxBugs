(a) A policeman shoots a person
(b) The person approaches the policeman
(c) The policeman holds a gun that is floating in the air
(d) The policeman slides backwards on the ground

Which event is a bug?

A:Let's reason the events according to the reference game's logic.

(a) The person approaches the policeman.

This is an event that should happen. The game should not allow the player to interact with the policeman if he or she is already dead or incapacitated.

(b) The person shoots the policeman.

This is an event that should not happen. The game should not allow the player to shoot the policeman if he or she is already dead or incapacitated.

(c) The policeman holds a gun that is floating in the air.

This is an event that should not happen. The game should not allow the player to hold a gun that is floating in the air.

(d) The policeman slides backwards on the ground.

This is an event that should happen. The game should allow the player to slide backwards if he or she is already dead or incapacitated.
