Which event is a bug?

A:Let's think like a game tester. In (b), the man jumps out of the car and collides with an oncoming vehicle. This should cause the man to be thrown out of the car and land on the ground. However, in (c), the man stays frozen in the same pose while flying through the air. This bug is caused by a glitch in the game code and is not supposed to happen.
